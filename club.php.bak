<h2 class="more"> HISTORY</h2></br></br>
<p class="less"> What is a soccer club? Who is the club? What does the club do?

These are commonly asked questions, and depending on whom you ask you will get a different answer from each person. If you ask a world soccer enthusiast, they will tell you it is a place of pride. If you ask an American soccer enthusiast, they will tell you it is a theory in our country. If you ask the average soccer parent, they will tell you they do not know or it is the team's name across the front of the jersey.

This will be an attempt to clarify the definition and purpose of a true soccer club in our country. Moreover, this will help you to understand what our soccer club is all about and the overall philosophy. First, a definition.

A soccer club is a community oriented organization whose purpose is to develop individual and team soccer excellence in order to compete at the highest level each individual and team is capable. Wow! That can have many different meanings and it certainly will have many different perceptions. What does that mean to you or the soccer player running around in your house?

<p class="less"> See it is not the coaches who put a whistle around their neck and demand that the player call him/her "Coach Johnson." The coaches that assist the game are the ones who live and breathe the game, the "soccer junkies" as I like to call them. The soccer junkies put the players first and always respect that the game is so humbling and so beautiful when it is the player's game. They are not only after team results as so many "coaches" are; they are after the game being played at a higher level. Hence, when the game is played at a higher level then the victories are in abundance, both in theory and in results.

<h3 class="more"> Assistant Coach Charles Carter</h3>
<p class="less">In order for the game to be played at a higher level, each player needs to be self-reliant in their quest to excel. Players cannot wait for direction from a coach the instant they have the ball at their feet, that is too late! For the instant the ball is at their feet is the instant they have to defeat their opponent. If they know what their options are prior to receiving the ball, they will defeat their opponent. A coach and/or parent cannot see what each player sees as they are receiving a ball so how can we make their decisions for them? We cannot! It is that simple!</p>

<h3 class="more"> Physician Lan Romero</h3>
<p class="less">Soccer education happens in two places: soccer training and soccer matches. Soccer training consists of team training, and the most important and impacting type of training, self-training. Each player who wishes to excel must seek time to train on their own, with a soccer ball, either in small groups of friends or in solitude. We as a club are defining these avenues for success with our players.

A club serves a greater purpose over that of an individual team or even the individual player. We work to keep the game in perspective and to keep our players in the right atmosphere to experience that same perspective. It is a question of community versus individual. So the question is not "What is a club?" Or "What does the club do?" The question is: "What will achieve greater results for our teams and individuals: we or me?"</p>
