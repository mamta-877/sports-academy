<h2 class="more">Typical Sport and Recreation Services</h2></br>
<p class="less">Sport and recreation organisations are service organisations, and ensuring that the quality of services meets the expectations of customers must be a high priority of those who manage the organisation. Failure to attain this objective leads to a diminished reputation and competiveness in the market place, and a consequential loss of customers.</br></br></br>
</p>
</div></div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<div class="col-md-12  p-2">
<h2 class="more">Coaching</h2></br></br>
<p class="less">Sport and Recreation experiences are more rewarding when participants receive instruction from "experts". As a result of such instruction and the skills learnt by participants, they will usually reach a higher standard of performance, acquire greater knowledge "of the game" and play more safely.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<div class="col-md-12  p-2">
<h2 class="more"> Facility Maintenance</h2></br></br>
<p class="less">The provision of facilities so that there is essential equipment and space to enable participation is a vital aspect of sport and recreation. Facilities need to be carefully maintained to comply with rules of sport and/or to enable participants to play safely.</p>
</div></div></div>
<div class="row mt-5">
<div class="col-md-4">
<div class="col-md-12  p-2">
<h2 class="more"> Organisation of Programs and Events</h2></br></br>
<p class="less">The organisation and scheduling of events and programs is a key service that enables people to actually participate. This service includes liaison with other sport organisations or clubs, coordinating officials where needed, and communication internally to ensure everyone knows what is happening.</br></br>

Other ANCILLARY SERVICES provided by a sport and recreation organisation include:</p>
</div></div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<div class="col-md-12  p-2">
<h2 class="more"> Registration and accreditation services</h2></br></br>
<p class="less">Sport and Recreation organisations need to ensure that coaches and instructors, and often the participants themselves are accredited for the activity. This necessitates keeping a database of accredited persons.</br></br>

The accreditation service is closely aligned with coaching and instruction services outlined above and ensures that participants have sufficient knowledge to undertake the activity safely.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<div class="col-md-12 p-2">
<h2 class="more">Fundraising Services</h2></br></br>
<p class="less">Sport and Recreation organisations frequently have to raise money to make improvements to facilities and programs.

Sport and Recreation organisations therefore need to raise money from a variety of sources including governments, the corporate sector (sponsorship), general fundraising from the public and engaging in profitable programs.</br></br>

Fundraising is a major preoccupation of most sport and recreation organisations. Sometimes professional fundraisers are employed.</p>
